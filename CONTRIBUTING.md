# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting an enhancement, or submitting a code change, your participation is welcome.

## How to Report a Bug

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/indexable-source/coursera/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/indexable-source/coursera/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## How to Suggest an Enhancement

If you have an idea for an enhancement, please open an issue to propose your change. This allows the community to discuss the proposal before any code is written.

4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear, descriptive commit message.
